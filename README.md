# CellScape

**Author:** William Ottenbreit  
**Version:** 1.0  

## About

CellScape is a collection of 8 interactive cellular automata (CA) and related simulations, coded in vanilla JavaScript as an experimental playground for procedural behavior and pattern generation.

## Simulations Included
1. **Forest Fire Simulation** – CA with closed borders that generates rivers alongside fire spread.
2. **Cyclic Simulation** – Cells update only when at least 2 neighbors are one step higher in value.
3. **Fractals** – A set of simple fractal generation rules.
4. **Diffusion Simulation** – Models diffusion-like spreading.
5. **Ecosystem Simulation** – Complex CA with multiple interacting entities and built-in data tracking.
6. **Circle + Noise Generator** – Hybrid of circle generation and structured noise, also forming "rooms."
7. **Rainfall Simulation** – Inspired by real rainfall patterns.
8. **Experimental Automata** – Miscellaneous rules for emergent behavior.

## Controls
- **Grid Size** – Adjust the grid resolution.
- **Automata Selection** – Choose one of 8 simulations.
- **Max FPS** – Set simulation speed.
- **Buttons** – Start/pause or change background color.

## Notes
- This project is currently non-modular but fully functional.
- Created for fun, learning, and as a showcase of CA concepts.

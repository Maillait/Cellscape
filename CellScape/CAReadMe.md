# CellScape

**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** William Ottenbreit  

## About
CellScape is a collection of 8 cellular automata (CA) and related simulations, created for fun and experimentation.  
Currently, the code is non-modular, but future updates may improve structure.

## Simulations Included
1. **Forest Fire CA** – A CA with closed borders, generating rivers alongside fire spread.  
2. **Mosaic CA** – Cells update only when at least 2 neighbors are one step higher in value, cyclic.  
3. **Fractals** – A set of two simple fractal generation rules.  
4. **Diffusion CA** – Models spreading behavior similar to diffusion.  
5. **Ecosystem CA** – A more complex CA with various interacting elements, with built-in data tracking.  
6. **Circle + Noise Generator** – A hybrid simulation of circle generation and structured noise, which also creates "rooms."  
7. **Rainfall CA** – Inspired by real rainfall, simulates raindrop patterns on the grid.  

## How to Use
- Adjust **Grid Size**, **Simulation Type**, and **Max FPS** with the sliders.  
- Press **“Pls Select Automata”** to start the chosen simulation.  
- Use **“Change Background Color”** for aesthetic changes.
